Sort arrays with sql sorting!

Here's how it works:
    1. Array gets inserted into a database file, index by index.
    2. Array gets selected from the database in ascending or descending order.
    3. Array gets loaded from the database, index by index.
    4. The array is now ordered in ascending or descending order.
